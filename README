The UShell Project
******************

This project bundles up some standard code that allows a Unity3D game to run external programs.

The example currently only works for Mac.  But I'm sure some clever person could put together a windows example in less than 45 seconds.  If so, please contribute!

UShell.unitypackage is currently a dependency for other projects:

1) June (https://github.com/srfoster/June)
2) Euclid (https://github.com/srfoster/Euclid)
